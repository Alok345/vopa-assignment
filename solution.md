Find the fastest 11 horses among 144 horses
➔ Only 12 horses can race at once.
➔ No stopwatch, only know finishing order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
Step 1:
Divide the 144 horses into 12 groups of 12 horses each.

Total races till now = 12 races (one race per group).

Step 2:
Race the winners (1st-place horse) of each group together.

Now you have a race among 12 winners.

This is the 13th race.

This race helps identify the overall fastest horse.


Step 3:
Find the top 11 horses:

First, the winner of the 13th race is obviously the fastest.

For the next 10 spots, you need to figure out carefully:

Horses who were 2nd and 3rd in the winning horse's group.

Horses who were 2nd, 3rd in groups of horses who came 2nd and 3rd in the final winner race.

Key: Only horses that were close in ranking need consideration.


Step 4:
So you only need a few more races between potential horses to identify the next 10 horses.

After analyzing — to find the top 11 horses exactly — you need 3 more races among the next best horses.

Final Minimum Races Required:

13 + 3 = 16 races

Important Assumptions:
We assume no two horses are equally fast (no tie condition).

We assume that horse performance is consistent (fast horse always beats slower ones).
